Who doesn't love talking about chocolate? Over the years I've had the good fortune of leading many chocolate demonstrations, having sculptures featured on national TV, and being intereviewed in multiple publications.

My personal highlights include being featured on a Food Network Valentine's Day special, and leading a demonstration during the _Sweet Symposium_ at Shelburne Museum.
