Hi there! I'm an accomplished artist and licensed Art Educator that was raised in northern Vermont. 

I have enthusiasm for all-things-crafty so you'll often find me sculpting things out of clay (or chocolate), painting on canvas, baking and decorating a cake, or crocheting a cute plant.

## Education

I have a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Montserrat College of Art, a certificate in Graphic Design from Champlain College, and a number of certifications from the New England Culinary Institute, Notter School of Pastry Arts, and the Barry Callebaut Chocolate Academy.
