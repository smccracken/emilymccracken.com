I'm a licensed art educator that <mark>recently accepted a position to teach K-4 art</mark> in northern Vermont. I start in the fall of 2023 and can't wait to share my contagious enthusiasm for all things crafty!

Previously I worked at a chocolate company where I lead demonstrations, taught classes, and created retail specialty products for 20 years.

My happiest moments came while integrating art into my job. Specifically building [chocolate sculptures](https://chocolatesculptress.com) that were used in our stores, [featured on the Food Network](https://chocolatesculptress.com/sculptures/cuckoo-clock/ "Giant Chocolate Cuckoo Clock on the Food Network"), and [put on exhibit](https://chocolatesculptress.com/sculptures/donut-shop/ "Donut Shop Chocolate Sculpture on display at Shelburne Museum") at the Shelburne Museum. 

Working with chocolate was a blast, but it was time for a change. I've always been grateful for the guidance of my art teachers and now I’m hoping I can help kids find their creative spark. ✨

From chocolate to crochet, I'm best when working with my hands &#8212; I'm a perpetual doodler, amateur baker, and retro treasure seeker. I love a good pun and still believe in the value of [hand lettering](/lettering/).
