I'm an accomplished artist and licensed art educator with a contagious enthusiasm for all things creative. <mark>I'm currently seeking a K&#8211;12 art teaching position in northern Vermont.</mark>

For the last 20 years I worked at a chocolate company leading demonstrations, teaching chocolate making classes, and creating [chocolate sculptures](https://chocolatesculptress.com) for display in our stores.

One of those sculptures was [featured on the Food Network](https://chocolatesculptress.com/sculptures/cuckoo-clock/) while another was [part of an exhibit](https://chocolatesculptress.com/sculptures/donut-shop/) at the Shelburne Museum.

From chocolate to crochet, I'm always working on something &#8212; I'm a perpetual doodler, amateur baker, and retro treasure seeker. You'll always catch me laughing at a good pun.
