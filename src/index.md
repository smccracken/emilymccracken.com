I'm a licensed Art Educator and currently seeking a teaching position within K&#8211;12 art. My passion for creativity is contagious and I believe there are always opportunities to integrate art into our everyday lives.

For the last 20 years I worked for a chocolate company where part of my job was to create [chocolate sculptures](https://chocolatesculptress.com) for display in our stores.

One of those sculptures was [featured on a Food Network special](https://chocolatesculptress.com/sculptures/cuckoo-clock/) while another was [on display for an exhibit](https://chocolatesculptress.com/sculptures/donut-shop/) at the Shelburne Museum.

From chocolate to crochet, I'm always working on something &#8212; I'm a perpetual doodler, amateur baker, and retro treasure seeker. My pun game is also very strong.
