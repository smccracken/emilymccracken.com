I'm a licensed Art Educator and currently seeking a teaching position within K&#8211;12 art. My passion for art is contagious and I believe in the power of being creative no matter what you're doing.

Over the last 20 years I worked for a chocolate company where I had the opportunity to create [chocolate sculptures](https://chocolatesculptress.com) for display in our stores. One of those sculptures was [featured on a Food Network special](https://chocolatesculptress.com/sculptures/cuckoo-clock/) and other [on display during an exhibit](https://chocolatesculptress.com/sculptures/donut-shop/) at the Shelburne Museum.

I'm proud of the joy that my sculptures brought to my community, particularly to children. I'd love the opportunity to continue bringing that joy as an educator.

I'm a perpetual doodler, amateur baker, and lover of all-things-retro. My pun game is also very strong.

Whether it's chocolate or crochet, I'd like to start sharing more of my creations and invite you to follow along:
